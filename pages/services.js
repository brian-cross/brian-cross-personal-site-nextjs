          <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>
            The first stage of building a new website is the design phase. This
            is where we determine the visual aesthetic of the site. Colors,
            logo, typography, page layout, navigation, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some clients already have their site design completed when they hire
            a developer. If not, I collaborate with the client to come up with a
            cohesive design for the site. Design is a discipline all its own,
            and I work with professional designers to ensure a professional
            result.

        <div className="text-block large">
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            The design is brought to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other
            functionality such as a CMS (content management system) or
            e-commerce are integrated as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            During development I provide regular updates and a temporary URL to
            preview the site as it's built.

        <div className="text-block large">
          <h3>Social Media Integration</h3>
          <p>
            I make full use of Facebook and Twitter standards for social media
            sharing. The client has full control over how a post looks when a
            link from their site is shared on social media platforms.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="text-block large">
          <h3>Hosting</h3>
          <p>
            Hosting of the final site can either be handled by me on a paid
            monthly basis, or the client can create their own hosting accounts
            and look after it themselves. It's up to the client. In the latter
            case, I can provide training on how to setup the required services.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="text-block large">
          <h3>Maintenance</h3>
          <p>
            After a site is complete and delivered, updates and maintenance are
            normally required. Since I use open source tools, any competent web
            developer will be able to handle it. The client can of course choose
            me to look after it on a monthly or hourly basis but it's not
            required. There's no lock-in when I build a project.
